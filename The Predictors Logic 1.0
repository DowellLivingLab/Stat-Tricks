#Logic for the ideation stage

1. Start
#we have used summary function to determine the number of Na's in the data given
summary(input_data)

#we also tried to fit normal distribution but it was not following its some basic properties such as the proportion of concentration of data corresponding to Z values.
#data is not plotted as belled shape

# we also tried to use the data as time series object but the main feature of multivariate time series data i.e  the variable to be co-integrated is I(1) does not fulfilled.

2. Imputation process for missing values

#we have used mean imputation, but it was not following the trend and adhering to dataset.
#mean imputation
(data_i$M4[which(is.na(data_i$M4))]=mean(data_i$M4,na.rm=TRUE))

# imputing the missing values 
# mice imputation using pmm method 'Predictive mean matching' 
# we used pmm method as data doesn't follow normal distribution so this method
#gives us an egde over regression method 

my_imp<-mice(input_data[,17:21],m=5,method="pmm",maxit = 200)
my_imp$imp$M4
summary(input_data$M4)
input_data[,17:21]=complete(my_imp,1)


3. Predicting future values

# prediction for the fifth week 
#we have assumed that data of monday in week 5 will be dependent on previous weeks data.
M5<-lm(input_data$M4~input_data$M1+input_data$M2+input_data$M3,data = input_data)
# similarly we have computed the values for rest 4 days

4. Quality process for imputation
#we have observed linear trend within the week
#we check the quality of imputation used

5. End
